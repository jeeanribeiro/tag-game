- The server runs on the port 3000, so if you run in your local machine, it will be accessible by LAN, VPN or publicly if ports are forwarded or DMZ are enabled in your router
- Access it by the IP of the server
- Chaser is red and others players are blue
- When chaser tags another player, that player becomes the new chaser
